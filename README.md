Introduction: A beginner's guide to C language. 
Open Dev c++ / Code Blocks / Vs code, copy this code and run the code. 
Enter your choices, and it will display a small guideline on how you should study C language. 
This is my first project and I am going to do additions in this in coming future because I am planning to launch my own app which guides beginners on how to go 
on their journey of learning C or any programming language as coming from a pre enginnering background it was hustle for me to figure out how to study provided the overwhelming content
that is available online. 
Thanks!
